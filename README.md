basic hangMan game 

Hello, in this repository you will find the code for the basic HangMan game.

It took me almost 4 hours. I thought it was going to be easy but I had a hardtime figuring out how to replace the dashes with actual words and
trying to think how to exit the game or tell the computer to recognize when the user has won. 

To run this code you do not need anything special everything is in the hangMan.java file. 

This was good challenge for me since It required some thinking and I liked that. It was easy to figure out how to get random words from the array and exiting and starting
a new game. But, I do think doing this challenge was a good experience.
